# Hey, I'm Dominik 👋

By day, I write code at [Slido](https://github.com/slidoapp) (part of [Cisco Systems](https://github.com/cisco)) so your meetings don't suck. By night, I solder things that probably void warranties.

Based in 🇸🇰 Bratislava, Slovakia — where the beer is cheap and the software engineers are not.

## What I Do

  🖥️ Build native desktop apps and integrations for macOS (Swift) and Windows (C#) — yes, both\
  🌐 Also do TypeScript, React, Node.js — because one ecosystem is never enough\
  🔌 Design PCBs and program microcontrollers — because software bugs weren't enough, I needed hardware bugs too\
  🖨️ 3D design & print things at 2 AM that I absolutely did not need

## Things I've Built at Slido

### [Slido for PowerPoint](https://www.slido.com/powerpoint-polling)
An integration that allows users to embed polls, quizzes, surveys, or Q&A directly into PowerPoint presentations and automatically launch them during the presentation.

This is the project I currently dedicate 90% of my working time to. I am primarily responsible for developing the integration for macOS, where I use Swift, C, C++, and even VBA. I also contribute to the development of the Windows integration (.NET/C#) and its frontend (React/TypeScript).


### [Slido for Google Slides](https://www.slido.com/google-slides-polling)
An integration that allows users to embed polls, quizzes, surveys, or Q&A directly into Google Slides presentations and automatically launch them during the presentation. It consists of several interconnected components (a Google Chrome extension, a Google Slides add-on, a custom web player, and the so-called Slido Sidebar).

In the early stages of the project, I contributed to the development of the Google Chrome extension as well as the Google Slides add-on. Later, a dedicated team was formed around the integration and fully took over the project.


### Slido Switcher
For 8 years, I was responsible for developing native applications for the Windows and macOS operating systems that enabled remote control of a computer directly from the Slido admin interface. This allowed presenters to seamlessly switch between Slido interactions and the presented content during a presentation.

The applications were gradually replaced by standalone integrations, Slido for PowerPoint and Slido for Google Slides, which provide even deeper integration and broader automation capabilities.

**Slido for Slack**
The Slido integration with Slack allowed users to create and manage Slido events, as well as ask questions directly within the Slack environment. Although it had a relatively successful campaign on Product Hunt, it did not attract a sufficient number of users during its lifetime, and its development was discontinued after two years.

For this integration, I implemented the backend (Node.js/TypeScript), the database (MySQL), and the interaction logic with the Slack API.


## Toys I Play With

- **Languages:** Swift, C#, TypeScript, C/C++ — I mass-collect languages like others collect stamps
- **Hardware:** ESP32, ESP8266, STM32, Arduino, Atmel AVR — if it has a chip on it, I'll flash firmware onto it
- **Tools:** Xcode/Visual Studio/WebStorm for programming, Autodesk Fusion for 3D modeling, KiCad for designing PCBs, a soldering iron for everything else...
