# Hey, I'm Dominik 👋

By day, I write code at [Slido](https://github.com/slidoapp) (part of [Cisco Systems](https://github.com/cisco)) so your meetings don't suck. By night, I solder things that probably void warranties.

Based in 🇸🇰 Bratislava, Slovakia — where the beer is cheap and the software engineers are not.

## What I Do

  🖥️ Build native desktop apps and integrations for macOS (Swift) and Windows (C#) — yes, both\
  🌐 Also do TypeScript, React, Node.js — because one ecosystem is never enough\
  🔌 Design PCBs and program microcontrollers — because software bugs weren't enough, I needed hardware bugs too\
  🖨️ 3D design & print things at 2 AM that I absolutely did not need

## Things I've Built at Slido

- **[Slido for PowerPoint](https://www.slido.com/powerpoint-polling)** — Making PowerPoint presentations interactive since before it was cool\
- **[Slido for Google Slides](https://www.slido.com/google-slides-polling)** — Same thing, different religion\
- **Slido Switcher** — A remote control app, because walking to your laptop is cardio\
- **Slido for Slack** — Polls in Slack, so you can procrastinate democratically

  ## Toys I Play With

- **Languages:** Swift, C#, TypeScript, C/C++ — I mass-collect languages like others collect stamps\
- **Hardware:** ESP32, ESP8266, STM32, Arduino, Atmel AVR — if it has a chip on it, I'll flash firmware onto it\
- **Tools:** Xcode/Visual Studio/WebStorm for programming, Autodesk Fusion for 3D modeling, KiCad for designing PCBs, a soldering iron for everything else...
